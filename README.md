# UX & Accessibility Notes

This repository documents real-world observations and notes on UX, accessibility,
and transparency in the regional availability of modern AI platforms.

## Focus Areas
- Regional accessibility and compliance-aware UX
- Transparent error handling vs. silent failure states
- User safety risks caused by ambiguous service blocks
- Documentation gaps in unsupported regions (e.g., Iran)

## Scope
This repository does **not** request service enablement, policy changes,
or circumvention of legal restrictions.

Its sole focus is on:
- Transparency
- User safety
- Clear, explicit failure states
- Documentation best practices

## Why This Matters
When platforms fail silently (generic timeouts, infinite loading, vague errors),
users naturally assume a fix exists.

This ambiguity often pushes users toward unsafe behaviors such as:
- Downloading modified or unofficial APKs
- Using untrusted proxy or sideloading tools
- Sharing credentials with third-party services

Clear communication is not political.
It is a UX, safety, and trust responsibility.

## Status
This is a living document intended for notes, summaries,
and references related to regional UX, accessibility,
and compliance-aware product design.
